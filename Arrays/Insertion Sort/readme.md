# Insertion Sort 

The Idea of the insertion sort is that we assume that a some part of array to be sorted and try to insert new element in its correct position by moving/shifting the sorted array elements to the right until the element apperaing in the sequence is larger than the current one.
We iterate in the reverse direction to move all the largest elements .
