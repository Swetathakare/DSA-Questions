# Selection Sort

Iterate through whole array and pick out the smallest element's index from the array and swap it with the 1st element [0th index] .Now 1st element is in correct position. Now, 
pick out the second smallest element from the array by looping from 1st index and remember the index then swap it with the second element [1st index]. Now  the second element is also in its correct position .
Similarly Iterate through the array n times  and insert all the elements in its correct position to sort the array.
