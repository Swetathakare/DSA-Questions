# Bubble Sort

n :- length of the array

In this sorting algorithm we have to swap the adjacent elements of the array if the element next to it is smaller than the current one .
In the first iteration the largest element from the array will be pushed at the end and in second iteration the second largest element is pushed at the second last position this is how we have to iterate array n times and do the swapping of adjacent elements in the array . And in n iterartions all the elements will be in its correct position.
